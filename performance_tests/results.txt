This dir contains extremely basic tests to compare performance differences
between JavaScript and low-level languages meant to be far faster.

Note that this is not at all a fair comparison because all C/C++/Rust code was
AI generated and will likely not be optimal. Only the JavaScript is
human-written. The purpose here was simply to see if the low-level languages
would win despite poor optimization.

The below results are sorted from best total time to worst total time.

Runtime    | Total time | Deflation      | Sorting bytes into lines
-----------+------------+----------------+-------------------------
Bun (JS)   | 10.529s    |  5.170 seconds |  5.359 seconds
C          | 10.826s    |  2.203 seconds |  8.623 seconds
C++        | 12.979s    |  2.576 seconds | 10.403 seconds
NW.js (JS) | 25.748s    |  5.784 seconds | 19.964 seconds
Rust       | 34.647s    | 22.777 seconds | 11.870 seconds
